By simulating device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, a better development environment can be created.\r\n\r\nThis spring we conducted a thesis called Erlang Embedded Simulation, which described how embedded development can benefit from simulation of device drivers. The code is written in the open source language Erlang, available at github(https://github.com/EmbeddedErlang/Embedded-Erlang-Simulation) and licensed under \"Apache License Version 2.0\". The target platform is Beagle Board (http://beagleboard.org/), an open source development board with an omap 3 chip including an arm Processor. The thesis is a continuation of the master thesis \"Erlang Embedded\" conducted by Fredrik Andersson, Fabian Bergstr\u00f6m, Gustav Simonsson and Henrik Nord, which presented at FSCONS last year. Following our thesis we started couple of experiments in regard to simulation of embedded systems. Main focus of our talk would be the simulation of embedded devices, and we would also like to present the work we have done after the thesis. Our thesis report is available here: (http://www.scribd.com/doc/55697604/Erlang-Embedded-Simulation-Thesis-Report)\r\n\r\nHere is an abstract from our thesis:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this thesis is to develop simulators for device drivers and to create and describe a work flow for developing on Erlang Embedded using simulators. The motivation is that frequently testing code on hardware is inconvenient, takes time and only is possible if you have access to the hardware. By simulating simple device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, this thesis aims to prove that a better development environment can be created.\r\nA development work flow describes how the current work flow with Erlang Embedded can be improved by using simulators. The idea is that you should be able to switch between real hardware and simulated mode by just changing an environment variable and providing necessary configuration files. No changes in code are required.\r\nA recorder tool was developed to support simulation of devices that generate data such as sensors. The recorder can also be used to quickly create a simulator replaying data traffic that have been recorded from an application previously. Taking advantage of dbg module, the recorder captures messages that a process receives or sends off without any modification to the source code. Using the recorder tool, no API or application logic is needed to simulation a sensor.\r\nThe thesis was conducted at Chalmers University of Technology under supervision of Erlang Solutions Ltd.

Jailbreaking (or rooting) is a common practice for many users for whom the ability to make mobile technology unique and representative of their own personality is an important asset of their choice of devices. For such users the freedom to use, adapt, modify technology, and make it last longer (both in terms of data and hardware) are guiding principles in their choice for technology artifacts.\r\n\r\nMobile technology has a more particular place in the hacking of technology devices. Mobile devices are designed for specific and largely inflexible use-patterns, with interfaces which tend to ignore or discourage the possibility of heavy customization or modification. This struggle for control over the device is challenged by jailbreakers - a process of breaking through the design and shaping the use of mobile phones according to the user's own needs and despite of the service provider's intentions.\r\nOne does not need to be a hacker to jailbreak their phone, but mostly to apply the hackers' principles when in touch with technology: the ideology of obtaining full control over the use of the device, the possibility of learning through using it, and the option to repurpose and find a longer life to this mobile technology, data and practices. In those terms hacking represents a particular philosophy rahter than a membership in a group or a community.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on three major principles of the hacker ethic that can be applied to the context of mobile devices use. The first principle relates to the freedom to use the technical artifacts and the ability to obtain the full control over them. The second incorporates the aspect of learning from the use of the mobile device, with the aim of adapting it to one's own needs even at the risk of 'voiding the warranty,' done in opposition to complying with the default settings and features offered by the mobile provider. The third principle considers repairing, reusing and repurposing the mobile devices \u2013 an act against the disposability paradigm and consumerist system of regular hardware upgrades that characterizes the mobile industry of today.\r\n"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "schedule.session", "fields": {"kind": "T", "intended_audience": "", "room": 4, "title": "BASIC DATA SECURITY", "track": 7, "presenters": ["andersson"], "time_slot": 18, "description": "A large part of our lives are now digital.

The project began in 1999 and the first architecture to be specified was OpenRISC 1000 which is a relatively simple 32-bit RISC CPU architecture. The CPU architecture has many optional features and instruction sets, making it suitable for scalable embedded implementation. The existing implementations are an architectural (transaction-level) simulator, or1ksim, and an RTL implementation, the OR1200 IP core. Ports of a GNU toolchain (binutils, GCC, GDB) and libraries (newlib, uClibc) for OpenRISC 1000 have also been implemented. The Linux kernel port for OpenRISC is in good shape and has been approved for inclusion in the upstream kernel. Ports of various RTOSes to OpenRISC also exist.\r\n\r\nThe project has undergone a renewal of sorts in the last two years, after a period of stagnation from 2005. A dedicated community has emerged and develops the architecture and implementations. The project has matured a great deal over the last two years, and the fruits can be considered a serious contender as the processor architecture for FPGA and ASIC implementations. This means there is now a viable and truly open source CPU solution to be considered along side the various proprietary, closed-source or obfuscated implementations provided by the likes of ARM, Xilinx and Altera. We feel that we would like to see greater use of truly open and free CPU implementations, and we would like to see greater participation in open source hardware development.\r\n\r\nThis CPU development ties in with a greater open source IP development effort existing on OpenCores.org. Along with open source CPU IPs, there are bus standards and various controller IPs that can be combined to implement a truly open source embedded system.\r\n\r\nThe community would therefore like to bring people's attention to this effort and offer both a presentation session and a workshop.\r\n\r\nThe presentation would be straight forward, and discuss the project so far, and what is in store for the future.\r\n\r\nA workshop will demonstrate how to get some of the existing OpenRISC-based System-on-Chip (SoC) designs up and running the OpenRISC Linux kernel port on various hardware. It would not require any previous experience with RTL design or FPGAs. Numbers would be limited and registration would be required. One catch is that we have not yet got a solid plan for how to provide the hardware (FPGA boards) for people to use during the session. Ideally we would organise some sponsorship for the session for a limited number of boards which are donated by the sponsors and then kept by the session participants to allow further experimentation later. If sponsorship cannot be organised, then the participants would be asked to pay for the boards themselves. The exact boards to be used is still to be determined.\r\n\r\nMore information on, and mailing lists for, the OpenRISC project can be found at the following links:\r\nOpenCores OR1K Wiki\r\nOpenRISC.net\r\nThe community also are found in #opencores on the Freenode IRC network."}}, {"pk": 27, "model": "schedule.session", "fields": {"kind": "T", "intended_audience": "", "room": 3, "title": "Off the grid: Is anonymity possible?", "track": 7, "presenters": [], "time_slot": 12, "description": "The discussions on the right to privacy have been active for over a century, with contributions from lawyers, ethicists, regulators and authors.
