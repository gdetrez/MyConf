Many times, what started as an adoption or aide for people with some disability, lead to the design of something that many people found very convenient or useful.

One could, of course, also argue for many other features of Free Software which makes it suitable for developing applications for solving problems with accessibility.

The code is written in the open source language Erlang, available at github(https://github.com/EmbeddedErlang/Embedded-Erlang-Simulation) and licensed under \"Apache License Version 2.0\". The target platform is Beagle Board (http://beagleboard.org/), an open source development board with an omap 3 chip including an arm Processor. The thesis is a continuation of the master thesis \"Erlang Embedded\" conducted by Fredrik Andersson, Fabian Bergstr\u00f6m, Gustav Simonsson and Henrik Nord, which presented at FSCONS last year. Following our thesis we started couple of experiments in regard to simulation of embedded systems. Main focus of our talk would be the simulation of embedded devices, and we would also like to present the work we have done after the thesis. Our thesis report is available here: (http://www.scribd.com/doc/55697604/Erlang-Embedded-Simulation-Thesis-Report)\r\n\r\nHere is an abstract from our thesis:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this thesis is to develop simulators for device drivers and to create and describe a work flow for developing on Erlang Embedded using simulators. The motivation is that frequently testing code on hardware is inconvenient, takes time and only is possible if you have access to the hardware. By simulating simple device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, this thesis aims to prove that a better development environment can be created.\r\nA development work flow describes how the current work flow with Erlang Embedded can be improved by using simulators. The idea is that you should be able to switch between real hardware and simulated mode by just changing an environment variable and providing necessary configuration files. No changes in code are required.\r\nA recorder tool was developed to support simulation of devices that generate data such as sensors. The recorder can also be used to quickly create a simulator replaying data traffic that have been recorded from an application previously. Taking advantage of dbg module, the recorder captures messages that a process receives or sends off without any modification to the source code. Using the recorder tool, no API or application logic is needed to simulation a sensor.\r\nThe thesis was conducted at Chalmers University of Technology under supervision of Erlang Solutions Ltd.

Jailbreaking (or rooting) is a common practice for many users for whom the ability to make mobile technology unique and representative of their own personality is an important asset of their choice of devices. For such users the freedom to use, adapt, modify technology, and make it last longer (both in terms of data and hardware) are guiding principles in their choice for technology artifacts.\r\n\r\nMobile technology has a more particular place in the hacking of technology devices. Mobile devices are designed for specific and largely inflexible use-patterns, with interfaces which tend to ignore or discourage the possibility of heavy customization or modification. This struggle for control over the device is challenged by jailbreakers - a process of breaking through the design and shaping the use of mobile phones according to the user's own needs and despite of the service provider's intentions. \r\nOne does not need to be a hacker to jailbreak their phone, but mostly to apply the hackers' principles when in touch with technology: the ideology of obtaining full control over the use of the device, the possibility of learning through using it, and the option to repurpose and find a longer life to this mobile technology, data and practices. In those terms hacking represents a particular philosophy rahter than a membership in a group or a community. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on three major principles of the hacker ethic that can be applied to the context of mobile devices use. The first principle relates to the freedom to use the technical artifacts and the ability to obtain the full control over them. The second incorporates the aspect of learning from the use of the mobile device, with the aim of adapting it to one's own needs even at the risk of 'voiding the warranty,' done in opposition to complying with the default settings and features offered by the mobile provider. The third principle considers repairing, reusing and repurposing the mobile devices \u2013 an act against the disposability paradigm and consumerist system of regular hardware upgrades that characterizes the mobile industry of today.\r\n"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "schedule.session", "fields": {"kind": "W", "intended_audience": "", "room": null, "title": "BASIC DATA SECURITY", "track": null, "presenters": ["andersson"], "time_slot": 25, "description": "A large part of our lives are now digital.

The Rep-rap project is taken as a point of departure for reflecting over the central idea in this and many other hacker projects, namely: that the world can be changed through the development of an alternative technology. In fact, this idea has less to do with new technology, and more to do with the creation of new social relations in which technology can be developed. It begs the question about the tension between those experimental, social relations and the pre-dominant relation, that is: the market relation. Bringing the technology to the market is often a necessity in order for a project to scale to the point where it becomes politically relevant. At the same time, however, the risk that the community will dissolve or have its goals distorted by the inflow of money is always present.

In 1983 he announced the project to develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been the project's leader ever since. With that announcement Stallman also launched the Free Software Movement. In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe GNU/Linux system, which is a variant of GNU that also uses the kernel Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are used in tens or hundreds of millions of computers, and are now preinstalled in computers available in retail stores. However, the distributors of these systems often disregard the ideas of freedom which make free software important.\r\n\r\nThat is why, since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as well as campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extension of copyright laws. Before that, Stallman developed a number of widely used software components of the GNU system, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other programs for the GNU operating system.\r\n\r\nStallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, and is the main author of the GNU General Public License, the most widely used free software license. \r\n\r\nImage credits:\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman (http://www.flickr.com/photos/gisleh/3305733501/) / Gisle Hannemyr (http://www.flickr.com/photos/gisleh/) / CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)", "staff": false}}, {"pk": "rickard-olsson", "model": "people.person", "fields": {"micro_biography": "", "name": "Rickard Olsson", "photo": "", "telephone": "", "blog": "", "physical_location": "", "microblog": "", "email": "", "biography": "", "staff": false}}, {"pk": "rikard", "model": "people.person", "fields": {"micro_biography": "", "name": "Rikard Fr\u00f6berg", "photo": "avatars/76421-96-20090823144843.jpeg", "telephone": "", "blog": "", "physical_location": "G\u00f6teborg", "microblog": "http://identi.ca/blondinrikard", "email": "", "biography": "", "staff": true}}, {"pk": "robert-scheck", "model": "people.person", "fields": {"micro_biography": "", "name": "Robert Scheck", "photo": "", "telephone": "", "blog": "http://www.robert-scheck.de/", "physical_location": "", "microblog": "", "email": "robert@fedoraproject.org", "biography": "", "staff": false}}, {"pk": "sam-tuke", "model": "people.person", "fields": {"micro_biography": "", "name": "Sam Tuke", "photo": "", "telephone": "", "blog": "", "physical_location": "", "microblog": "", "email": "samtuke@fsfe.org", "biography": "", "staff": false}}, {"pk": "sandra-derbring", "model": "people.person", "fields": {"micro_biography": "", "name": "Sandra Derbring", "photo": "", "telephone": "", "blog": "", "physical_location": "", "microblog": "", "email": "", "biography": "Sandra Derbring is a computational linguist at DART, a regional rehab center\r\nfor people with communication disorders.
