<address><a href="mailto:volunteer@fscons.org">volunteer@fscons.org</a></address>

<h3>In the meantime</h3>

<p>While you are (impatiently) waiting for our answer, there is a couple of things you can do:

<ul>
<li>read our <a href="http://fscons.org/manifesto">Manifesto</a> to get familiar with our core values ;
<li>explore our <a href="http://wiki.fscons.org/">wiki</a> where we try to gather the information on the conference's organization ;
<li>Just Do It(tm) ! Start working on some aspect of the conference where you think you can help.
</ul>

<p>Thanks !
