            "description": "Frequently testing code on hardware is inconvenient, takes time and only is possible if you have access to the hardware. By simulating device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, a better development environment can be created.\r\n\r\nThis spring we conducted a thesis called Erlang Embedded Simulation, which described how embedded development can benefit from simulation of device drivers. The code is written in the open source language Erlang, available at github(https://github.com/EmbeddedErlang/Embedded-Erlang-Simulation) and licensed under \"Apache License Version 2.0\". The target platform is Beagle Board (http://beagleboard.org/), an open source development board with an omap 3 chip including an arm Processor. The thesis is a continuation of the master thesis \"Erlang Embedded\" conducted by Fredrik Andersson, Fabian Bergström, Gustav Simonsson and Henrik Nord, which presented at FSCONS last year. Following our thesis we started couple of experiments in regard to simulation of embedded systems. Main focus of our talk would be the simulation of embedded devices, and we would also like to present the work we have done after the thesis. Our thesis report is available here: (http://www.scribd.com/doc/55697604/Erlang-Embedded-Simulation-Thesis-Report)\r\n\r\nHere is an abstract from our thesis:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this thesis is to develop simulators for device drivers and to create and describe a work flow for developing on Erlang Embedded using simulators. The motivation is that frequently testing code on hardware is inconvenient, takes time and only is possible if you have access to the hardware. By simulating simple device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, this thesis aims to prove that a better development environment can be created.\r\nA development work flow describes how the current work flow with Erlang Embedded can be improved by using simulators. The idea is that you should be able to switch between real hardware and simulated mode by just changing an environment variable and providing necessary configuration files. No changes in code are required.\r\nA recorder tool was developed to support simulation of devices that generate data such as sensors. The recorder can also be used to quickly create a simulator replaying data traffic that have been recorded from an application previously. Taking advantage of dbg module, the recorder captures messages that a process receives or sends off without any modification to the source code. Using the recorder tool, no API or application logic is needed to simulation a sensor.\r\nThe thesis was conducted at Chalmers University of Technology under supervision of Erlang Solutions Ltd.

(Less than most people think; but the part they *did* play was essential.) What are the possibilities of these new tools, what are their limitations, what are their dangers? How did people communicate while Internet access was shut down? How do activists deal with censorship, blocking, online surveillance? What can be done to help from the outside? What lessons can we learn for the inevitable moment when it will be time for us to rise up and start the #europeanrevolution? (just kidding... mostly. ;))\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: This is a very rough first outline - I haven't made up my mind on how exactly I'll spin this, but the above is what I'm thinking at this point. It doesn't really fit into any of the proposed tracks. It just seems to me that it would be odd to have a Free Society conference without discussing what's happening in the Arab world, so I figured I'd suggest it anyway. :))\r\n\r\nAbout me: I had the honour of being a keynote speaker at last year's FSCONS so some of you probably know me already. I'm a post-graduate student at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna, specialising in the Middle East. Just spent a week in Syria to try and figure out what the hell is going on there, so I have at least a bit of an insight into what I'll be talking about...\r\n\r\nThis is for your internal consideration only, please don't publish it.\r\n\r\nOh, one thing. If you decide you're interested in having me do this presentation, I'll have to ask you to exclude it from your video coverage. \"It's an ongoing and dynamic situation\", as they say, and I'd rather not have this video show up on the first page of Google hits for my name forever after.\r\n\r\nHappy Ramadan!"

            "description": "People often personalize the places and objects that surround them, and despite of their short life and fast disposability mobile phones make no exception. Jailbreaking (or rooting) is a common practice for many users for whom the ability to make mobile technology unique and representative of their own personality is an important asset of their choice of devices. For such users the freedom to use, adapt, modify technology, and make it last longer (both in terms of data and hardware) are guiding principles in their choice for technology artifacts.\r\n\r\nMobile technology has a more particular place in the hacking of technology devices. Mobile devices are designed for specific and largely inflexible use-patterns, with interfaces which tend to ignore or discourage the possibility of heavy customization or modification. This struggle for control over the device is challenged by jailbreakers - a process of breaking through the design and shaping the use of mobile phones according to the user's own needs and despite of the service provider's intentions.\r\nOne does not need to be a hacker to jailbreak their phone, but mostly to apply the hackers' principles when in touch with technology: the ideology of obtaining full control over the use of the device, the possibility of learning through using it, and the option to repurpose and find a longer life to this mobile technology, data and practices. In those terms hacking represents a particular philosophy rahter than a membership in a group or a community.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on three major principles of the hacker ethic that can be applied to the context of mobile devices use. The first principle relates to the freedom to use the technical artifacts and the ability to obtain the full control over them. The second incorporates the aspect of learning from the use of the mobile device, with the aim of adapting it to one's own needs even at the risk of 'voiding the warranty,' done in opposition to complying with the default settings and features offered by the mobile provider. The third principle considers repairing, reusing and repurposing the mobile devices – an act against the disposability paradigm and consumerist system of regular hardware upgrades that characterizes the mobile industry of today.\r\n"

The majority of the talk will cover\r\na hands-on workshop of how to setup a local APT repository with upload\r\ncapabilities with reprepro.\r\n\r\nTime: 2 hours\r\n\r\nPrerequisities: Computer with Debian GNU/Linux (or APT based distribution,\r\nalthough results and procedure may vary widely)."

            "description": "Free software reside on the four freedoms of use, learning, improving, and\r\nsharing. These freedoms are put into legal context by licenses. The free\r\nsoftware eco system is built on top of a jungle of licenses. Disregarding\r\nthe standard flamewars of which license are more free, how do we analyze\r\nhow licenses affect user freedom? Moreover, what consequences does these\r\nlicenses have when put together?\r\n\r\nThis talk will investigate free software licenses where consequences and\r\nanalysis will be done from a Debian perspective.\r\n\r\nTopics that will be covered include The Debian Free Software Guidelines\r\n(DFSG), Debian archive areas (main, contrib, non-free), GPL (in)compatible,\r\nsource code vs. data, commercial worries, etc. Basically, what Debian\r\nthinks is free or not, as well as how conclusions are drawn.\r\n\r\nTime: 1 hour"

The GVCS includes machines, equipment, tools, components, and other infrastructures for creating a complete economy: food, fuel, energy, building materials, transportation, materials, and fabrication.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share:\r\n* the current state of GVCS development\r\n* how we are implementing:\r\n- Lifetime Design\r\n- Open Collaborative Development\r\n- Open Documentation\r\n- Open Business Model\r\n* the development of OSE Europe\r\n\r\nhttp://opensourceecology.org/"
