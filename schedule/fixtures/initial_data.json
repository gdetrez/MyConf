By simulating device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, a better development environment can be created.\r\n\r\nThis spring we conducted a thesis called Erlang Embedded Simulation, which described how embedded development can benefit from simulation of device drivers. The code is written in the open source language Erlang, available at github(https://github.com/EmbeddedErlang/Embedded-Erlang-Simulation) and licensed under \"Apache License Version 2.0\". The target platform is Beagle Board (http://beagleboard.org/), an open source development board with an omap 3 chip including an arm Processor. The thesis is a continuation of the master thesis \"Erlang Embedded\" conducted by Fredrik Andersson, Fabian Bergstr\u00f6m, Gustav Simonsson and Henrik Nord, which presented at FSCONS last year. Following our thesis we started couple of experiments in regard to simulation of embedded systems. Main focus of our talk would be the simulation of embedded devices, and we would also like to present the work we have done after the thesis. Our thesis report is available here: (http://www.scribd.com/doc/55697604/Erlang-Embedded-Simulation-Thesis-Report)\r\n\r\nHere is an abstract from our thesis:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this thesis is to develop simulators for device drivers and to create and describe a work flow for developing on Erlang Embedded using simulators. The motivation is that frequently testing code on hardware is inconvenient, takes time and only is possible if you have access to the hardware. By simulating simple device drivers like serial ports, buttons and led, this thesis aims to prove that a better development environment can be created.\r\nA development work flow describes how the current work flow with Erlang Embedded can be improved by using simulators. The idea is that you should be able to switch between real hardware and simulated mode by just changing an environment variable and providing necessary configuration files. No changes in code are required.\r\nA recorder tool was developed to support simulation of devices that generate data such as sensors. The recorder can also be used to quickly create a simulator replaying data traffic that have been recorded from an application previously. Taking advantage of dbg module, the recorder captures messages that a process receives or sends off without any modification to the source code. Using the recorder tool, no API or application logic is needed to simulation a sensor.\r\nThe thesis was conducted at Chalmers University of Technology under supervision of Erlang Solutions Ltd.

Jailbreaking (or rooting) is a common practice for many users for whom the ability to make mobile technology unique and representative of their own personality is an important asset of their choice of devices. For such users the freedom to use, adapt, modify technology, and make it last longer (both in terms of data and hardware) are guiding principles in their choice for technology artifacts.\r\n\r\nMobile technology has a more particular place in the hacking of technology devices. Mobile devices are designed for specific and largely inflexible use-patterns, with interfaces which tend to ignore or discourage the possibility of heavy customization or modification. This struggle for control over the device is challenged by jailbreakers - a process of breaking through the design and shaping the use of mobile phones according to the user's own needs and despite of the service provider's intentions. \r\nOne does not need to be a hacker to jailbreak their phone, but mostly to apply the hackers' principles when in touch with technology: the ideology of obtaining full control over the use of the device, the possibility of learning through using it, and the option to repurpose and find a longer life to this mobile technology, data and practices. In those terms hacking represents a particular philosophy rahter than a membership in a group or a community. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on three major principles of the hacker ethic that can be applied to the context of mobile devices use. The first principle relates to the freedom to use the technical artifacts and the ability to obtain the full control over them. The second incorporates the aspect of learning from the use of the mobile device, with the aim of adapting it to one's own needs even at the risk of 'voiding the warranty,' done in opposition to complying with the default settings and features offered by the mobile provider. The third principle considers repairing, reusing and repurposing the mobile devices \u2013 an act against the disposability paradigm and consumerist system of regular hardware upgrades that characterizes the mobile industry of today.\r\n"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "schedule.session", "fields": {"kind": "W", "intended_audience": "", "room": null, "title": "BASIC DATA SECURITY", "track": null, "presenters": ["andersson"], "time_slot": 22, "description": "A large part of our lives are now digital.

The initial development of the AUGMENT-Project also includes the production of a prototype for sharing information. The joint set up and unfolding of public digital spaces and co-operative creation of processes and infrastructure for user-driven accessibility information is making use of existing handheld mobile phones which offer the possibility to upload pictures and comments via an application with a map-based interface. The research initiative is exploring and comparing cross-cultural participatory methods for cultivation of shared transformational spaces. The paper discusses both the notion of user-driven content and co-creation of tools and methods, drawing upon the tradition of Scandinavian Systems Design, explicitly arguing for direct user-representation in systems development.

The discussion revolves mainly around the conflict between humanity and technology in relation to rights, convenience and order \u2013 and has resulted in various attempts to regulate the state in relation to the individual. However, two important, and recent, shifts have turned this discussion on its head and fundamentally erased much of the progress in individual rights made in the last century. These shifts in technology and state require a radical re-thinking of the privacy debate and the future of privacy."}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "schedule.session", "fields": {"kind": "T", "intended_audience": "", "room": null, "title": "Free Software in the Swedish public sector", "track": 8, "presenters": ["daniel-melin"], "time_slot": 1, "description": "How far has the Swedish public sector climbed the mountain \"Kings of\r\nFree Software usage\"?\r\nWho is using Free Software today?\r\nWhat kinds of Free Software are popular?\r\nWhat about support?\r\nHas the Swedish public sector started climbing at all?\r\n\r\nThese are all questions that could make you feel uneasy.

It includes surround  speakers, 3-dimensional sounds, infrared sensors, accelerometer control and music. \r\n\r\nInvisi-ball is a playful way to practice how to orient yourself only using your ears. For those who recently have become blind and for those of those who can see - to better understand a life without sights.
